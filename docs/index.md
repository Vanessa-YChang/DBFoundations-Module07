## Introduction
This week we learned how to use below built-in MS SQL functions to retrieve information from a database. 
1)	Selecting with common functions: like CAST, CONVERT, STR, CONCAT, FORMAT, IIF, CASE, ISNull, ISNumeric, ISDate, Left and Right, LTrim and RTim, REPLACE, PATINDEX, SUBSTRING Date/Time and Soundex().   
2)	Partitioned or Window function, over(partition col): using Over-Partition function let us group by only some of the columns.
3)	Ranking Functions, RANK( ): return a ranking value for each row in a partition.   
4)	Lag and Lead: shows the previous or following values based on a giving group of values. 
5)	Using functions for reporting: start off with a simple select statement and build on it by adding more and more detailed code to finally get what we expect. When the code is too complex, we can create a reporting view to save the code for reuse. 
6)	User Defined Functions (UDF): except above MS SQL built-in functions, we can create custom functions, it called User Defined Functions or UDFs. There are 2 basic functions, one returns a single value and another one returns a table value.
